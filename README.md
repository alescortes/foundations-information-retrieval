# Foundations of Information Retrieval
Repository for the "Foundations of Information Retrieval" course @ UTwente (NL), 2022/2023.

The project is a comparison of different feature extractor methods for CBIR.
Used the MSLS dataset for Visual Place Recognition tasks.
Employed both standard Computer Vision feature extractors (ORB, SIFT, SURF) and Deep Learning (VGG16), exploring different distance metrics.
Performance was evaluated using Top Recall@K (R@K) and Mean Average Precision (mAP).
Python libraries used: OpenCV, scikit-image, Tensorflow.
